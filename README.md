    NAME: Trivia Game
    AUTHOR: Mitch Rogers
    DESCRIPTION: I built a trivia game in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Before doing this 
                 project I had no professional experience in React development and have enjoyed
                 learning few of its many features. I focused on the easy to use animations and
                 transition features that React offers with useSpring, useEffect, and Bootstrap. 
                 
                 A pretty simple directory was built out after creating the app (create-react-app)
                 and most of the app came preconfigured. I added some organization to the src
                 directory with a folder holding all React components and a folder holding my data
                 is json format. I would have liked to implement a feature for the user to use in order to submit their own category and quiz questions and answers. I realized a little into it that it would be too big for the scope of this project. 

                 When the user visits the website they'll be prompted to pick a category in which they can answer some trivia questions. I pre-populated the game to have four categories to choose from. As the user navigates through the site, each React component is called and presented. As they answer the questions, they are given the correct/incorrent response in real time. I use state throughout the project and specifically to keep track of how many questions the player has answered correctly. 

                 Once they have finished the chosen category questions. They are directed to the result component and leaderboard to view their results. 

                 Future implementations: 
                    -   I would really like to add the ability for a user to submit a category and the minimum of 6 questions and answers and have it loaded onto the site. It would take their inputs and format them into a json file in the data dir.
                    -   I couldn't get a side panel effect for the leaderboard. I was trying to implement this feature using a react component but could not. I elected to use CSS to create a simple dropdown leader score on the results page. I would like to get the panel working with leaders from all categories. I will need to study a bit more on the use and movement of state. 
                    -   Lastly, I would've liked to implement a timer animation for each question. I think it would add style and make it feel more game-like.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
